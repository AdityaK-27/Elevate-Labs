# Elevate Labs Internship – Data Analyst Intern Role

I am grateful to have been selected for the **Data Analyst Internship** at **Elevate Labs**, an opportunity that allows me to explore data analysis and reporting in a professional setting. I would like to thank the Elevate Labs team for this chance to grow and contribute meaningfully.

## 🗓️ Day 1 Progress

On the first day of the internship, we began by working with a dataset and performing essential data cleaning tasks. Our objective was to identify inconsistencies and prepare the data for meaningful analysis. 

Specifically, I:
- Loaded and explored the raw dataset to understand its structure.
- Identified and handled missing values.
- Standardized column formats (e.g., date formats, numerical consistency).
- Used a comma as the delimiter while importing the dataset to resolve formatting issues.
- Prepared the dataset for further exploration and insights in the coming days.

This README will be continuously updated as the internship progresses. I’m excited to learn more and tackle more complex challenges ahead!

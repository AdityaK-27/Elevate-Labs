# Elevate Labs Internship – Data Analyst Intern Role

I am grateful to have been selected for the **Data Analyst Internship** at **Elevate Labs**, an opportunity that allows me to explore data analysis and reporting in a professional setting. I would like to thank the Elevate Labs team for this chance to grow and contribute meaningfully.

## 🗓️ Day 1 Progress

On the first day of the internship, we began by working with a dataset and performing essential data cleaning tasks. Our objective was to identify inconsistencies and prepare the data for meaningful analysis. 

Specifically, I:
- Loaded and explored the raw dataset to understand its structure.
- Identified and handled missing values.
- Standardized column formats (e.g., date formats, numerical consistency).
- Used a comma as the delimiter while importing the dataset to resolve formatting issues.
- Prepared the dataset for further exploration and insights in the coming days.

## 🗓️ Day 2 Progress

On the second day, we focused on **Data Visualization and Storytelling** using the **Superstore dataset** in Tableau. The goal was to create dashboards that communicate actionable insights effectively.

Specifically, I:
- Connected Tableau to the Superstore dataset and explored key fields like `Sales`, `Profit`, `Ship Mode`, and `Segment`.
- Created two interactive dashboards:
  - **Story 1 – Sales & Profit Analysis:** Highlighted top-performing categories and visualized profit distribution by geography and product line.
  - **Story 2 – Shipping Strategy Impact:** Evaluated how different shipping methods affect delivery time, profit, and segment behavior.
- Practiced using maps, bar charts, scatter plots, and calculated fields.
- Annotated visuals to enhance business storytelling and clarity.
- Exported both dashboards as screenshots for submission and portfolio documentation.

📂 Files created:
- `Sales & Profit Analysis – Superstore.png`
- `Shipping Strategy Impact Dashboard.png`
- `README.md` (documenting all cleaning and visualization tasks)

This README will be continuously updated as the internship progresses. I’m excited to learn more and tackle more complex challenges ahead!

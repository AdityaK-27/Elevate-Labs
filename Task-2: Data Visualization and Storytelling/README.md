### 🚚 Story 2: Shipping Strategy Impact

1. 📦 **Ship Mode vs Profit**
   - Compared shipping methods and their profitability.
   - Insight: Same Day delivery is least profitable despite its speed.

2. ⏱️ **Average Delivery Time by Ship Mode**
   - Calculated delivery days using a calculated field (`DATEDIFF`).
   - Insight: Standard Class has longest delivery and mixed profit.

3. 👥 **Ship Mode by Segment**
   - Built stacked bar chart to show segment-wise shipping preference.
   - Insight: Consumers tend to choose faster (but less profitable) options like Same Day.
